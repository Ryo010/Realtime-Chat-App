# Realtime-Chat-App

A fullstack project which let's users chat in real time with each other.The users can either login or create a new account and then start chatting with their fellow users. Users can send text messages and images in chat, choose their profile pics and choose a beautiful theme of their choice from the 32 themes found in settings.



I have used MERN stack for this project and the entire code is written in javascript. The project has been deployed on render, link to project -> https://realtime-chat-app-0dau.onrender.com
